# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Enginnering is the development of software that meets user requirements and make the world a better place.Its importnt because it makes the world a lot easier 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of a programming language 
The rise of Agile methologies 
The establishment of Software Engineering 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - Gathering user needs and system requirements 

Design - creating detailed designs of the user interface 

Implementation - writing code to meet the design specifications 

Testing - testing software to check if they meet quality standards

Deployment - the availability of the product to users 

Maintenance - the constant upgrading of the product due to ever changing needs by the user 


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall Methology follows a step by step method of doing things ,while the Agile Methology follows a flexable way with no step by step method .A scenario of a Waterfall method is building a house and building it brick by brick while a Agile method is building a website wuthout knowing how you want it to look like 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A Software Developer is the one responsible for writing the code 
A Quality Assurance Enginner is the one responsible for checking the quality of the code 
A Project Manager is responsible for the planning of the task and execution of the task 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs offer tools to code and debug E.g VSC
VCS are used to supply work to teammates E.g Github


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Staying up to date - As this career is ever changing so SEs have to stay relevant ,SEs have to be willing to learn new things

Time manangement - SEs are often required to work with tight deadlines .Working in teams will narrow the tight deadlines 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit - testing the code 
Intergration - testing the different interactions between the components 
System - testing the entire system as a whole 
Acceptance - testing the software if it meets the user requirements 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt Engineering is asking an AI model questions with specific requirments .Its important with intercting with AI models because it can provide you with exactly hat you need from it with the given instructions 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
What is Software Enginnering?
What is Software Enginnering.Does it involve coding.Explain this to child.Add emojis 
Its more effective because its more specific and detailed
